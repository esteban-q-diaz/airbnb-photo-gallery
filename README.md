# airbnb-photo-gallery

For this project I wanted to recreate the AirBnb NavBar and Photo Gallery section of the AirBnb location details page. AirBnb's UI design is creative and innovative - it was really fun implementing some of those UI elements.

Project deployed here: https://airbnb-gallery-clone.herokuapp.com/

# Demo:

## Step 1
* Establish a schema for MySQL database / add data points to the database
* Create a visual of the overall idea and routes of the Application

## Step 2
* Create a rough draft of the AirBnb site with all aspects in place using hard coded data
* At this stage I did not include any CSS. I mainly focused on getting the information of the photo gallery and navigation bar down.

## Step 3
* Start adding CSS to make the application look like the original
* One of the biggest design challenges was recreating the AirBnb drop down seach menu - but once I finished, it was worth the hours spent on it!

## Step 4
* Implement React router to navigate to and from the "show all photos"

## Step 5
* Generate an Express server
* Establish a functional connection between the Client, Server and Database
* Pull data from Database and render it onto the client
