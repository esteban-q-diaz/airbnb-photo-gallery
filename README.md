# REI Clone (Customer Reviews Microservice)

Collaborated with a team of 3 to create a Full Stack REI Clone Application with full functionality.  To establish a successful workflow we created a clear code of conduct, practiced Agile workflow to meet delivarables.  The results were an REI Clone application that closely resembles the actual REI Page.

# Customer Review Section

My contribution to the team was the REI Customer Reviews section.  I implemented the following

* New Review submission modal with full functionatlity - allows users to post reviews and see them rendered immediately
* Sort by star review
* Filter by Most Recent, Most Relevant, Most Helpful, Highest to Lowest, Lowest to Highest
* Add to helpful count (yes/no)
* Load more pagination - loads 12 reviews at a time
